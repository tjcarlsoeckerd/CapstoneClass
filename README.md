Senior Capstone Spring 18
Professor al-Saffar
Proposal
	So what we are looking at doing currently is to learn python over the rest of the semester to use for our project. We feel that python is the most easy to learn language for our current task of scraping a live video stream.
	What we need is permission from campus safety to install a video camera on the light post in the center of the Kappa complex parking lot facing away from the Kappa complex to better test for day and night contrast. As a test run of the system we would want the camera to be installed to gather data and fix bugs in the recognition algorithm. The other thing that we will need for our camera is some power input as well
	We are still learning how to stream the video and we are still just dipping our toes in the water on video scrapping. Please let us know if you have any suggestions about it. We both know how to do a small scale website scrape but it becomes much more complex when it becomes a live-streaming video. One of the things that we have come across in our search of knowledge is called AForge.NET. We think it may be useful due to that it keeps popping up on various forums about video processing and because it is open source. Have you ever heard of this/ would you be able to advise using this or not?
